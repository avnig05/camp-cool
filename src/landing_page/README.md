# Camp Pool Landing Page

This Next.js web application for the Camp Pool landing page.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or later recommended)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation) (version 8.x or later recommended)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up and running:

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the project repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd landing_page
```
Replace `<your-repository-url>` with the actual URL of the Git repository.

### 2. Install Dependencies

This project uses PNPM as its package manager. PNPM is fast and efficient with disk space. To install all the necessary libraries listed in the `package.json` file, run the following command in the project root directory (`landing_page`):

```bash
pnpm install
```
This command will download and install all the dependencies and devDependencies required to run the project. PNPM will create a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file (if one doesn't already exist or needs updating) to ensure consistent installs across different environments.
